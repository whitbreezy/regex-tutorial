# Regex Tutorial

This tutorial is intended to help developers and software development students better understand regex. Regex is short for regular expression, and can be used to find patterns of characters within strings, or find and replace character(s) within a string.

## Summary

In this tutorial, I will be explaining the regex for matching a Hex Value. This can be helpful when trying to make sure hex values for colors are being used correctly in a development project.

Regex for matching a hex value: /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/
